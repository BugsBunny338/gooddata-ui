## Supported versions

In order to make the user experience with integrating GoodData UI SDK as smooth and secure as possible and to ensure that the SDK is using the latest features of the platform, we will only provide support to two most recent major versions of UI SDK.

The most recent majors will be supported in the following modes:

- The latest major version will receive all new functionality and all bug fixes
- The previous major version will only receive fixes to critical issues and security fixes. These fixes will be applied on top of last released version of the previous major

The customers are encouraged to always use the latest version of the UI SDK.

In case of using older versions, the user might face API incompatibility, performance or security issues.
