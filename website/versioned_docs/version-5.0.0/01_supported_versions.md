## Life cycle phases

Each version of GoodData.UI goes through the following phases:

1. **General Availability** (GA)
    * **When it starts:** When a major version is publicly released. To get notified about a new version, subscribe to the [Release Notes](https://support.gooddata.com/hc/en-us/sections/203564877).
    * **What it means:** A version in GA is going through active development, receives all new features and bug fixes, which are applied on top of the last minor version.

2. **End-of-Development** (EOD)
    * **When it starts:** When a newer major version is publicly released.
    * **What it means:** A version in EOD receives only security fixes and fixes for critical issues. These fixes are applied on top of the last minor version. No new features are added.

3. **End-of-Support** (EOS)
    * **When it starts:** The date is defined by GoodData.
    * **What it means:** A version in EOS receives neither new features nor bug fixes. No technical support is provided. Although the version is still available for use, we do not recommend that you use it.

4. **End-of-Life** (EOL)
    * **When it starts:** The date is defined by GoodData.
    * **What it means:** A version in EOL is removed from the GoodData platform and is not available for use.
