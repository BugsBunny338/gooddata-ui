Create your first analytical application using GoodData.UI and UI Developer Toolkit.

**UI Developer Toolkit** is a CLI-based tool that will guide you through the process of creating the application step by step in your terminal application. To start, go to https://github.com/gooddata/gooddata-create-gooddata-react-app, and follow the instructions in the README file.

**NOTE:** Before you start, make sure that you have a GoodData account (see [About GoodData.UI](about_gooddataui.md#supported-technologies)).
