We have created a number of simple interactive examples using CodeSandbox.ui. Each example points to a CodeSandbox screen that includes a simple GoodData.UI code next to a resulting visualization.

Feel free to play with the sample code in your browser to see how the visualizations update just after changing the component properties - for your convenience, we have added hints to most of the examples.

Let’s start with a simple headline widget!

_Note: for the sake of simplicity, we have put a proxy in front of the GoodData platform so the sample code doesn’t need to worry about [authentication or single sign on](30_tips__sso.md)._
